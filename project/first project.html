                        <h5>Use colors:</h5>
                        <p>Colors create focal points in compositions and also highlight certain elements of your choice.
                             In this example, the use of red draws our attention to the glow of the color.
                              Red is a strong color, and in this particular design, we feel the passion for that bright color rising across the page.
                             Think about the meanings different colors have and how highlighting a single meaning in your design can support your book.</p>

                        <h5>Be creative:</h5>
                        <p>Allow yourself the opportunity to come up with a place to put things on the page, and know that there is no standard way to design your book cover
                            , so try ways to make your design as unique as the content inside. If you look at the following example,
                             you will see that placing the address in a text box directly above the man's eyes is a nice gesture in order to maintain his confidentiality. 
                             As well as his gesture, lighting only half of his face. It doesn't take much to make a compelling stylistic choice;
                              The goal is to create something that stands out and speaks for your book.</p>

                        <h2>Third Feature</h2>
                        <h5>Use avatars:</h5>
                        <p>You can take a simpler approach and still use images, 
                            so that the image does not need to take up the entire cover,
                             but can serve well as a complement to the overall design. 
                            While the paper is graphically interesting, it only leads us to read the title of the book as a focal point.</p>
